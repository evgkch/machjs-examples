# machjs — examples

Examples for [`@evgkch/machjs`](https://github.com/evgkch/machjs), a small typed Mealy state machine. Each one is a working page built on the published package: plain HTML and TypeScript, no framework. Every example comes with a walkthrough of the same code, line by line.

## Running locally

One Vite project holds every example: the index page is at the root, each example at its own path.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # tsc --noEmit + build to dist/
npm run preview   # serve the build
```

The examples depend on the package from npm, so nothing has to be built in the library repository first. To try them against unreleased changes, build the library and link it — from the library checkout, then from this one:

```sh
npm run build && npm link      # in machjs
npm link @evgkch/machjs         # here
```

## The shell

Three files at the root are shared by every example page:

| File                           | What it holds                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`page.css`](page.css)         | The running text and the two properties the tokens have no opinion about      |
| [`shell.css`](shell.css)       | The full-screen frame: the bar, the stage, the dock, the deck — and the skin  |
| [`shell.ts`](shell.ts)         | `dockEdge` — the switch that moves the panels between the side and the bottom |

An example writes `@import "../../shell.css";` and then `@layer subject { … }`, and styles what is on the stage. The furniture is not its business.

**The tool is Gruvbox.** A region marked `class="tool"` — the dock, the bar's switches, a legend standing under a machine — is painted in Gruvbox in both schemes, while the page keeps the tokens' own palette. A reader never has to ask whether what is in front of them is the application or the instrument watching it.

It is a region and not a widget, on purpose: some of what the inspector draws *is* the subject. The schema under review in `review` is edited in `machjs-editor` and drawn in `machjs-diagram`, and it is the document, not the instrument — so it stands outside a marked region and keeps the page's colours, while the pipeline reviewing it sits in the dock, in the tool's.

The skin is a block of custom properties and nothing more: the widgets read the palette as custom properties, and custom properties inherit through a shadow root.

## Adding an example

1. A directory with `index.html` and `src/`, next to `selection-rect`. Asset paths in the markup are relative — `./src/main.ts`, not `/src/main.ts`.
2. An entry in `build.rollupOptions.input` in [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts): Vite does not look for pages on its own.
3. A card in [`index.html`](index.html) — copy the existing `<li class="card">` and change the text and links.

## Relation to the library repository

[`evgkch/machjs`](https://github.com/evgkch/machjs) includes this repository as a submodule at `examples/`, and publishes the site from it: pushing here changes nothing on the site until the submodule pointer in `machjs` is moved to the new commit.

MIT.
